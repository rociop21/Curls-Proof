## Curls-Proof

## Description

This proyect is a tooll for people who wants to follow the Curly Girl Method by Lorraine Massey. The initial idea was just to analyze the given ingredients and tell if the product contains any banned ingredients (according to the method's approach of damaging ingredients) or not.
It's so commun to get lost with so much information on the internet and people usually give up on the method a few moths later without really giving it the chance, so my contribution was organizing this information.

## Roadmap

Currently, I have plans to add more features such as comments, users and a blog page.
